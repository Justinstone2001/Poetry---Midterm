Library: Poetry 

Documentation URL: https://python-poetry.org/docs/ 

Description: Poetry is a package to help developers manage the 
necessary code dependencies needed to run and access code, regardless
of what is installed on their own machine. 

This library ensures that all team members have the correct library versions 
installed to run the code and facilitates the process of getting
everyone's machine up to date. 

Installation Instructions:
  Because Poetry is a dependency manager, it must be installed in an isolated
  virtual environment separate from your system. This is done to ensure that
  Poetry's own dependencies are secure from updates/uninstalls. To do this, 
  Poetry is installed using pipx. pipx must be installed prior to installing
  Poetry.

  Poetry Install:
  1. Run this command in the terminal:  pipx install poetry
  2. To update: pipx upgrade poetry
  3. To uninstall: pipx uninstall poetry
